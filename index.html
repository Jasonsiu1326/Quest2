    <p id="main"style="text-align:left; "><b>Black Lives Matter began as a call to action in response to state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism.  Our intention from the very beginning</b></p>
    <p id="main"><b>was to connect Black people from all over the world who have a shared desire for justice to act together in their communities.</b></p> 
    <p id="main"><b>The impetus for that commitment was, and still is, the rampant and deliberate violence inflicted on us by the state.</b></p>
